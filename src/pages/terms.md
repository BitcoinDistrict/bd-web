Some jurisdictions may limit these exclusions, and liability will be limited to the greatest extent permitted by law.

## "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" Disclaimer

The Service is provided "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" without warranties of any kind, including merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement. We do not guarantee uninterrupted, error-free operation or compatibility with other systems. Some jurisdictions may not allow certain warranty exclusions, so these limitations may not apply fully to you.

## Severability and Waiver

### Severability

If any provision is unenforceable, it will be adjusted to achieve its objectives to the extent possible, and other provisions remain in effect.

### Waiver

Failure to enforce a right or obligation does not waive it for future enforcement, nor does waiving a breach waive subsequent breaches.
