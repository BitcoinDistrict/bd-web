        testimonial: `I emerged from the digital shadows to attend a Bitcoin District meetup, and wow, what a blast! Between the real good coffee and debates over inscriptions, I nearly revealed my identity just to settle a 10-minute rant about forks—turns out, staying mysterious is cheaper than winning arguments. The coffee was as strong as the hodlers, though, so I’ll be back!`,

        testimonial: `I rolled into the Bitcoin District meetup thinking I’d school these degens on why QE infinity keeps the world spinning. Big nope. They hit me with 'inflation is theft' and '1 BTC = 1 BTC' so hard I nearly choked on my freshly printed dollar bills. By the end, they were preaching 'HODL forever' while I was googling how to escape a room full of laser-eyed maxis. 10/10, my printer’s still shaking.`,

        testimonial: `I strolled into the Bitcoin District meetup, ready to dazzle everyone with XRP’s genius as a bridge currency. Oops. The maxis stared at me like I’d just praised paper money, then broke into a chorus of 'there’s only one coin' and 'enjoy your altcoin fantasy.' One guy even slipped me a 'hope you recover' note for my XRP stash. I walked out humbled—slightly toasted—but clutching a shiny new Bitcoin sticker. Worth it?`,
