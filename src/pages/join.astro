Between the real good coffee and debates over inscriptions, I nearly revealed my identity just to settle a 10-minute rant about forks—turns out, staying mysterious is cheaper than winning arguments. The coffee was as strong as the hodlers, though, so I’ll be back!`,

They hit me with 'inflation is theft' and '1 BTC = 1 BTC' so hard I nearly choked on my freshly printed dollar bills. By the end, they were preaching 'HODL forever' while I was googling how to escape a room full of laser-eyed maxis. 10/10, my printer’s still shaking.`,

The maxis stared at me like I’d just praised paper money, then broke into a chorus of 'there’s only one coin' and 'enjoy your altcoin fantasy.' One guy even slipped me a 'hope you recover' note for my XRP stash. I walked out humbled—slightly toasted—but clutching a shiny new Bitcoin sticker. Worth it?`,
