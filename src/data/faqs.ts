We’re a community, not a business, so our goal isn’t to sell you anything or push specific Bitcoin services, exchanges, or investments. That said, businesses are a valued part of our community—they might sponsor events, share insights through speakers, or offer their own products and services. That’s totally fine! We’re here to foster learning and connection, and we warmly welcome everyone—businesses included—who wants to join us in that mission."
